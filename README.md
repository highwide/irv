irv = Irv.new(['John', 'Paul', 'Ringo', 'George'])

irv.poll!(['John', 'George', 'Ringo'])
  .poll!(['John', 'Ringo', 'George', 'Paul'])
  .poll!(['Paul', 'George', 'Ringo', 'John'])
  .poll!(['Ringo', 'Paul', 'George'])
  .poll!(['George', 'Ringo', 'John'])

puts irv.winner

# => 'George'
```

### Why George was choosen in this example?

#### Round 1

|      |A|B|C|D|E|
|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|
|John  |1|1|4|-|3|
|Paul  |-|4|1|2|-|
|Ringo |3|2|3|1|2|
|George|2|3|2|3|1|

John got two first ranked votes. But it wasn't the majority.
So, Election goes on without last place candidate.

In this case, Paul, Ringo and George got one first ranked vote.
How was second ranked vote?  Paul got only one vote. Ringo and George got two.
Therefore Paul got lose in this round.

#### Round 2

|      |A|B|C|D|E|
|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|
|John  |1|1|3|-|3|
|Ringo |3|2|2|1|2|
|George|2|3|1|2|1|

John and George got two first ranked votes. Ringo got one.
So, Ringo got lose in this round

#### Round 3

|      |A|B|C|D|E|
|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|
|John  |1|1|2|-|2|
|George|2|2|1|1|1|

George got three first ranked votes! It was a majority. So George became winner.

#### If you want to know these stuff in a Ruby program

```ruby
# After polled...

result = irv.result
result.process.each { |pr| puts "round: #{pr.order} /majority: #{pr.majority} / loser: #{pr.loser}" }

# => round: 1 /majority:  / loser: Paul
# => round: 2 /majority:  / loser: Ringo
# => round: 3 /majority: George / loser:
```
